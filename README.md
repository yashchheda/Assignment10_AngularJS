a. Do you find the code to be simpler when using AngularJS? If so, how? If not, why?

It is simpler to use Angular JS as it uses MVC and makes the behavior/event handling much cleaner on the front end. There is need to create a single controller (Simple Controller) that contains the logic of the main index.html page. The JS code remains unchanged despite change in the div class name or id. The predefined directives help prevent extensive length of code in Jquery.

b. Would a beginner to front-end development find the code to be simpler? Why or why not?

Yes, a beginner would find it simpler to code as there is no need to install software. All one has to do is follow tutorials and create modules and controllers. One can follow the directives at http://docs.angularjs.org/api. Also angular is a structural framework meant for dynamic web apps.

c. How might the structure provided by AngularJS simplify building larger web applications?

AngularJS helps to minimize the size of the application into a Single Page Application. There are controllers of multiple views loaded on the page. Thus, to modify any specific part, the developer can change it because of dependencies injunction. There are some AngularJS functions such that there is two-way data binding that eventually makes most of the code base disappear.
